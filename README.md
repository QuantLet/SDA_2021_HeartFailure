Description: This project aims to predict the death of patients suffering from heart disease. In this way, it might be possible to adapt the treatments and maybe avoid heart failures in some cases.

Keywords: heart failure, death prediction, EDA, logistic regression, Decision classification tree, Random Forest Feature Selection, Test Accuracy

Additional Info: This repository look at the feastures that explained the most the death of a patient suffering from heart disease. First there is an explanatory data analysis with distribution of the features and their correlation. Then, different models have been implemented : logistic regression, Decision classification tree, Random Forest Feature Selection and Test Accuracy
